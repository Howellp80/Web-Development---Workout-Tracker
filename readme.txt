This project had us create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app for tracking completed exercises. The information related to your exercises is stored in a Database. 

To run:
copy the provided files to your directory
Setup Node and related frameworks, etc. (See package.json)
Setup a MySQL server and update "dbcon.js" with the connection information

Start your website and visit:  yourwebsiteaddress/reset-table
Now you can add, read, edit, and delete exercises as needed.  :)
